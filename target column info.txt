Burnout calculation formula (simple weighted average)
burnout_level = (emotional_drain + exhausted_after_rest + concentration_difficulty + disconnection + dislike_factor) / max_possible_score * 10


We can simplify for now by just adding the scores and scaling to 10 if necessary.

The “dislike factor” adjusts slightly based on enjoyment.
